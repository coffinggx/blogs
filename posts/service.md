Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Statiic APi Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.
  Here's some JavaScript code:

```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log("Hello World");
})`
```
